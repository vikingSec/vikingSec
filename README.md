### What I'm currently working on...
#### [GrabbrApp](https://grabbrapp.io) (Closed Source)
GrabbrApp is a SaaS application that allows security and OSINT researchers to research malicious infrastructure securely.

It uses ephemeral infrastructure to grab malware, scan servers or look up domain information for you so that you don't have to risk revealing your digital identity to the owners of the server. It also allows you to do all of this at scale with a single API.

[Go check it out, sign up for a free account or look at the premium offerings for early features, priority support and extended API quotas](https://grabbrapp.io).

You can also get updates [on the GrabbrApp Changelog](https://valhallaresearch.net/GrabbrApp/Changelog)

### [Consulting and Freelancing](mailto:mitch@secresearch.io) (Let's work together)

I love new challenges, so I'm always open to freelance and consulting work, either in cyber security in general or software development specifically.

You can reach me at mitch@secresearch.io to chat with me about your projects.
#### [Dan](https://github.com/vikingSec/dan) (Open Source)
DAN, or Decentralized Analyst Network, is an open source data collection and analysis platform for OSINT and cyber security researchers. It will serve as a federated, decentralized network of instances that share data between each other to allow researchers to benefit from collaboration and a transparent, open data sharing network.

You can check out the repo for DAN [here on GitHub](https://github.com/vikingSec/dan) or [read up on the ChangeLog on my blog](https://valhallaresearch.net/DAN/Changelog) for more updates.
